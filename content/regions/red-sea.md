# The Red Sea

The Red Sea corridor is one of the world's most strategically significant waterways. Roughly 12% of global trade passes through it via the Suez Canal and the Bab el-Mandeb strait, connecting the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean.

## Key Dynamics

The region's importance stems from energy transit. Oil and liquefied natural gas shipments from the Persian Gulf flow northward through the Red Sea to European and North American markets. Disruption at either chokepoint (Suez to the north, Bab el-Mandeb to the south) forces rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope, adding two weeks and significant cost to shipping.

Saudi Arabia and Egypt anchor the northern and western shores respectively. Saudi Arabia's NEOM megaproject and Red Sea tourism developments represent a long-term bet on the western coast as an economic corridor beyond oil. Egypt derives substantial revenue from Suez Canal transit fees, making waterway security an existential economic interest.

Djibouti hosts military bases from the United States, China, France, Japan, and Italy, making it the most concentrated site of foreign military presence in Africa. Its location at the Bab el-Mandeb strait gives base-hosting nations direct surveillance and response capability over Red Sea traffic.

## The Houthi Disruption

Houthi forces in Yemen began targeting commercial shipping in late 2023 in response to the Israel-Gaza war. These attacks have substantially disrupted Red Sea transit. Major shipping companies rerouted vessels around Africa, increasing costs and delivery times across global supply chains.

The US and UK launched airstrikes against Houthi positions in Yemen, but the attacks on shipping continued. Iran provides the Houthis with missile and drone technology, giving a non-state actor the ability to threaten a critical global trade artery.

## Competing Interests

Saudi Arabia and the UAE were previously engaged in a military intervention in Yemen's civil war, backing the internationally recognized government against the Houthis. That intervention wound down without a decisive outcome, and the Houthis now control most of Yemen's populated western territory.

Eritrea maintains a closed, militarized posture along the southwestern Red Sea coast. Sudan's ongoing civil war has destabilized the western shore, with competing factions receiving support from Egypt, the UAE, and other regional actors.

## External Powers

The United States maintains its primary regional military presence through the Combined Maritime Forces headquarters in Bahrain and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. China's base in Djibouti, operational since 2017, was its first overseas military installation and signals long-term interest in protecting its Indian Ocean trade routes.

Russia has pursued a naval facility agreement with Sudan at Port Sudan, though the civil war has complicated implementation. France maintains a significant garrison in Djibouti as part of its Indo-Pacific posture.

## Outlook

The Red Sea's strategic value will increase as global trade volumes grow and energy transition timelines extend reliance on Gulf hydrocarbon exports. The demonstrated ability of the Houthis to disrupt shipping with relatively low-cost weapons has introduced a persistent threat that conventional naval power has struggled to neutralize. The region will likely see continued military buildup from both regional and external powers.
